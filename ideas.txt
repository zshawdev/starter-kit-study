##Ideas and todos

-documentation on how to set up this project's enviroment for future web dev interns, possibly within readme
-comment out dark/light toggle to temporary disable
-About us page too dull, should be image with text and alternating positions, then founder message to follow. We can reuse the about pages .sidebyside class
-Projects page could become the events page. On hover Text can overlay the image with details, then user could click to learn more. Or we could
make cards with an image above and text description below, click to read more.
-Nix reviews page, instead make it CCS's Store page and reuse the .sidebyside 
-do we need sponsors on every page, if so, add to footer a container to hold them. Find way to display neatly
-Footer needs the six social media icons.


## Required Content and images

- meta
    -description
    -keywords?
    -sample image to be shared with backlinks when shared

- fav icons:
    -180x180 png
    -32x32 png
    -16x16 png
    -192x192 png android-chrome
    -384x384 png android-chrome

-logo (height around 66px~), svg preferably (fiverr). 
    Gradient was a concern earlier but we can recreate radial gradient with css with element behind logo

-custom fonts if needed

-color scheme
    -primary, primaryShade(ligher version of primary), primaryDark(darker, unsaturated primary)

    -current colors for reference...
    --primary: #FFBA19; hsl 42°, 100%, 55%
    --primaryShade: #ffd675; hsl 42°, 100%, 73%
    --primaryDark: #805d0d; hsl 42°, 82%, 28%

-hero image scaled for >600px and <600px viewport width

-all other images scaled correctly considering viewport width >600px and <600px
